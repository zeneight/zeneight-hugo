### Arriving & Introduction

Hello, I’m Agung. Im from Indonesia, I’m an IT specialist at CWB that help teaching students overseas who interested with IT/Coding/Programming. Recently I’m teaching two students from Cambodia and Myanmar. Their name are Thy and Myu. We’re studying using an online platform called Skype to connect from different countries. We do a lot of learning, discussing on basic programming, IT stuff and other things too. We do a class once on a week but usually when they had some problem, they would ask directly to me via group or Personal Chat. After a while learning, the skills they earned from studying could be used for making a project or helping people on their community who has a problem on IT. For example Thy, one of my student from Cambodia make a Phumasia’s website. This website help to promote the phumasia community.As you could see, the skills they got from learning on my class not only for supporting themselves but also it could contribute to their community too. We could contribute not just using money but our skills or knowledge  could help them too. They really appreciate for what they got.

### An experience when travelling to Cambodia

And actually, from last Monday until today, I’m staying at Cambodia. I’m here for some mission. It’s to support my students Thy and Myu to make an e-commerce projects. Also some other things too In Phumasia and Kui community. When I arrived here, I’m thinking that maybe I could not fit or there some of the culture shock. But there is not much different on the city from my country. The city atmosphere It’s kind of similar. I stayed in Chnai Market for a few days. Chnai Market is a shop that sell art, craft and also sell some zero waste product. Thy actually has a project to make an e-commerce website for the shop. And I’m supporting him right now to give some brief how to make it. 

While staying at Cambodia I’m also visit Phumasia in Kampong Thom. This is where I met with Cher Den who taking care of me when im in Phumasia. There were some students who also live there. I’m really impressed when I’m staying there, cause every morning they cooked my food, and it’s very delicious. I’m saying this cause I’m not a good cook.

### Kui Community

I’m also visiting Kui Community with Den and Thy on the following day. It’s about 30km from phumasia. We’re going by motorbike. There we met with locals and had some lunch. They’re very friendly. We stayed there one night over there. When I stayed there, I just realised something, it’s like the culture there almost the same as my hometown culture, it’s different but have some similarities. It’s kind of interesting to see something similar outside of your hometown. We also met with some Japanese who also visiting, we actually having some lunch together and also talk each other with locals too. There is also one Japanese, his name is Kazu, he is here at Cambodia to help one of the Cambodian named Mony to plan and grow a good rice in SCY.In Kui community we also go to the cricket’s farm. I’m actually a bit shocked here, because I don’t know that the cricket is actually is being used for food. The food here is for human, that’s why I’m shocked because on my home country, we actually just use it for birds food not human food. Then Thy offer one of the cooked cricket to me, I’m hesitated first but when I’m tasting it, it actually delicious. But I need sometime to adapt for eating it the second time.

### Making website for Kui Community

Next is the project on Kui CommunityWhen we stayed at Phumasia, Den told us, also with Thy and make a suggestion to build a platform to help the Kui Community. The concept of the platform is how the kui people also could contribute to the community itself, not only that bu also promote, and to preserve the culture. So we decided to make a library website called Kuipedia. This website could store information like a library and people of koi could use the website as their knowledgebase. Of course because it will placed on the internet, people from the outside could also check the website. This project is being worked by Thy and also me, we already finish the design and just yesterday we already presented the website to the community mostly is the students there. Their response is very good and also very interested. We also coordinated with them that who will also be the leader to guide the other student using the website.I’m just very happy that I could contribute to the community by building the website. It’s the same as Kazuki too in SCY that help them by sharing knowledge on his field. 

### What to do next?

Tomorrow I will leaving Cambodia to go back to Bali, It’s a bit sad that I’m cannot meet some of my friends here, like Thy and Myu, but I’m thinking we still could contact from Skype and also I could come here too one day. When I go back to the Bali, I just want to continue to contribute by supporting the students here. Actually we have two projects that still ongoing, it’s the Kuipedia website and also the e-commerce website for the shop. I’m gonna still continue to discuss and have a meeting with Thy, Myu and Den from Cambodia about these projects. We hope that we still could work together and help each other even when we’re on different Countries. 

### Conclusion

In conclusion we could help people not only just using money or by giving them an items but we could share our knowledge and skill too to help them, there is also a lot possibility you could discover when working overseas, sometime it would make you amazed.
